# Time Series Modeling in Medical Revenue Forecasting

## Comprehensive Overview

This project is centered on a detailed application of time series modeling techniques to a dataset containing two years of daily revenue data from a healthcare organization. The primary objective is to leverage this data to forecast future revenue, with a keen eye on uncovering any underlying patterns that might correlate with patient readmission rates. This endeavor aligns with the organization's broader goals of optimizing financial planning and enhancing patient care strategies.

## In-Depth Objective Analysis

**Primary Goal:** Develop a sophisticated time series model capable of accurately forecasting daily revenue for the upcoming quarter.

**Secondary Aim:** Identify data patterns potentially linked to patient readmissions, thus enabling the organization to proactively address these issues.

## Research Question Elaboration

**Key Inquiry:** Can the historical daily revenue data over the past two years be utilized effectively to forecast revenue for the subsequent quarter, and what implications might this have for understanding patient readmission dynamics?

## Methodological Justification and Assumptions

**Time Series Modeling Rationale:**

- **Stationarity:** Emphasizes the necessity of stationarity in the data, ensuring consistency in mean, variance, and autocorrelation.

- **Autocorrelation Insight:** Highlights the significance of data points being influenced by their predecessors, allowing the model to detect and leverage recurring patterns for accurate forecasting.

## Rigorous Data Preparation and Transformation

**Visual Analysis and Time Step Formatting:**

- Visualization: A comprehensive line graph offering a clear visual representation of the time series, showcasing trends, seasonal patterns, and potential anomalies.

- Data Span and Integrity: Careful examination of the date range (January 1, 2021, to January 1, 2023) and meticulous identification of any gaps or inconsistencies in the data sequence.

**Stationarity Assessment and Transformation:**

- Initial Non-Stationarity: Initial analysis revealed non-stationary characteristics, confirmed through visual trends and Augmented Dickey-Fuller test results.
