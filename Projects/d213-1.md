# Time Series Modeling in Medical Revenue Forecasting

## Comprehensive Overview

This project is centered on a detailed application of time series modeling techniques to a dataset containing two years of daily revenue data from a healthcare organization. The primary objective is to leverage this data to forecast future revenue, with a keen eye on uncovering any underlying patterns that might correlate with patient readmission rates. This endeavor aligns with the organization's broader goals of optimizing financial planning and enhancing patient care strategies.

## In-Depth Objective Analysis

**Primary Goal:** Develop a sophisticated time series model capable of accurately forecasting daily revenue for the upcoming quarter.
**Secondary Aim:** Identify data patterns potentially linked to patient readmissions, thus enabling the organization to proactively address these issues.

## Research Question Elaboration

**Key Inquiry:** Can the historical daily revenue data over the past two years be utilized effectively to forecast revenue for the subsequent quarter, and what implications might this have for understanding patient readmission dynamics?

## Methodological Justification and Assumptions

**Time Series Modeling Rationale:**
- **Stationarity:** Emphasizes the necessity of stationarity in the data, ensuring consistency in mean, variance, and autocorrelation.
- **Autocorrelation Insight:** Highlights the significance of data points being influenced by their predecessors, allowing the model to detect and leverage recurring patterns for accurate forecasting.

## Rigorous Data Preparation and Transformation

**Visual Analysis and Time Step Formatting:**
- Visualization: A comprehensive line graph offering a clear visual representation of the time series, showcasing trends, seasonal patterns, and potential anomalies.
- Data Span and Integrity: Careful examination of the date range (January 1, 2021, to January 1, 2023) and meticulous identification of any gaps or inconsistencies in the data sequence.
**Stationarity Assessment and Transformation:**
- Initial Non-Stationarity: Initial analysis revealed non-stationary characteristics, confirmed through visual trends and Augmented Dickey-Fuller test results.
- Transformation Process: Applied differencing technique to achieve stationarity, subsequently verified through a second Augmented Dickey-Fuller test.
**Splitting Data for Model Training and Testing:**
- Data Segmentation: Strategically divided the dataset into an 80% training set and a 20% test set, ensuring both stationary and original data formats were included for comprehensive model training and evaluation.

## Model Identification and Analytical Deep Dive

**Extensive Data Analysis Techniques:**
- Examination of seasonal components, underlying trends, autocorrelation functions, spectral density analysis, and a thorough decomposition of the time series.
- Rigorous verification of trend absence in the residuals of the decomposed series, ensuring model reliability.
**ARIMA Model Selection Process:**
-Utilized the auto_arima function for optimal model selection, incorporating parameters for seasonality and performing a comprehensive search across possible model configurations to identify the best fit for the data.
Forecast Execution and Model Outputs:
Conducted a future revenue forecast using the selected ARIMA model, with detailed outputs including stationarity tests, autocorrelation insights, and the final SARIMAX model summary.
**Code Implementation and Support:**
- Provided extensive code for SARIMAX implementation and supplementary analysis, encapsulated in the attached files for full transparency and replicability.

## Detailed Data Summary and Strategic Implications

**Analytical Findings and Model Selection Insights:**
- ARIMA Model Rationale: In-depth exploration of ACF and PACF led to the selection of an ARIMA model, tailored to the dataset’s characteristics.
- Forecast Precision: The prediction interval for the forecast was set with a 95% confidence level, striking a balance between accuracy and forecast horizon.
- Forecast Duration Justification: Opted for a quarter-long forecast to maximize accuracy, given the length of the historical data and the nature of the time series.
**Forecast Visualization and Comparative Analysis:**
- An annotated graphical representation comparing the forecast from the final model against the actual test set data, highlighting the model’s predictive performance.
**Actionable Recommendations Based on Results:**
The forecast's accuracy suggests that the model can serve as a reliable tool for financial planning. Additionally, the organization is advised to analyze the correlations between revenue trends and patient readmission patterns to inform future healthcare strategies.
