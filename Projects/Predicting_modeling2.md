# Predicting Modeling Using Logistic Regression

## Objective:

This project aimed to apply logistic regression to a comprehensive medical dataset, with the goal of identifying key variables that predict the probability of patient readmission. This analysis is vital for healthcare organizations seeking to minimize readmission rates and enhance patient care.

## Research Question Analysis:

The central research question focused on determining the factors within a medical dataset of 50 variables and 10,000 records that influence the likelihood of a patient being readmitted. The dataset's complexity offered a rich opportunity to uncover significant health risk factors.

## Method Justification:

Logistic regression was the chosen method due to the binary nature ('Yes' or 'No') of the target variable, 'Readmis'. Python's extensive data processing capabilities made it an ideal choice for handling the dataset. The use of Python, favored for its adaptability in various industries and powerful processing capacity, allowed for efficient manipulation, processing, and analysis of the extensive data.

## Data Preparation:

The data preparation process was comprehensive, ensuring the dataset's readiness for logistic regression. This involved meticulous cleaning steps such as the removal of duplicates, null values, and irrelevant columns, as well as outlier treatment. Key variables like 'ReAdmis', 'Complication_risk', and 'Initial_days' were transformed from categorical to numerical forms using encoding techniques.

## Model Analysis:

An initial logistic regression model incorporating all 19 identified features was constructed and subsequently refined to a reduced model through backward step elimination. This process aimed at eliminating non-significant features, resulting in a model with 14 relevant predictors. The reduced model was compared with the initial one, focusing on accuracy and the interpretation of coefficients.

## Findings and Implications:

The reduced model effectively highlighted the influence of various health-related factors on readmission rates. Key findings included the impact of initial hospitalization duration, complication risks, and specific medical services on readmission likelihood. Despite its high accuracy, the model's potential overfitting and reliance on binary medical features were noted as limitations, suggesting the need for further data enrichment and analysis.

## Recommendations:

t is recommended to continuously update the model with new patient data to validate and enhance its predictive accuracy. Further, a more granular examination of statistically significant variables using detailed health data could provide deeper insights into specific risk factors affecting patient readmission.
