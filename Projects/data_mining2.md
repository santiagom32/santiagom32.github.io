Objective:

To apply Lasso regression to a comprehensive medical dataset, aiming to identify key factors influencing the length of initial hospital stays ('Initial Days') and thereby assist in reducing patient readmission rates.
Research Question Analysis:

The core question of this project was to determine whether the 'Initial Days' variable could be predicted by other variables in the medical dataset, and to identify the most influential variables.
Method Justification:

Lasso regression was chosen for its efficacy in handling large datasets and its ability to highlight significant features by minimizing non-relevant variables to zero. This technique was expected to pinpoint key factors influencing initial hospital stays.
Data Preparation:

The data preparation process involved transforming all categorical features to numeric and scaling continuous variables, essential for Lasso regression. This included employing one-hot encoding and label encoding techniques to effectively convert categorical variables for analysis.
Analysis Technique:

Using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn, Lasso regression was implemented with 10-fold cross-validation to find the optimal alpha value. The analysis focused on identifying the most influential variables affecting the 'Initial Days' target variable.
Findings and Implications:

The Lasso model demonstrated high accuracy, as indicated by a substantial R-squared value. However, it revealed that the 'Total Charge' was the only significant feature influencing 'Initial Days', suggesting a limitation in the dataset's diversity and depth.
Recommendations:

It is recommended to enhance the dataset with more detailed medical data, moving beyond binary categorical features to include more nuanced and continuous variables. This would allow for a more precise identification of risk factors affecting initial hospitalization durations.
