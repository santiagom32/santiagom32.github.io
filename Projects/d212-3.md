# Market Basket Analysis in Medical Prescriptions

## Overview
The project employs market basket analysis to explore intricate patterns in a medical market dataset, specifically focusing on medication prescriptions. This analytical approach aims to unearth hidden correlations within prescription data, which might indicate trends in co-prescribed medicines. The overarching objective is to leverage these findings in identifying risk factors associated with patient readmissions, ultimately contributing to better healthcare management strategies.

## Objective
The primary goal of the project is to meticulously analyze prescription data to detect patterns of frequently co-prescribed medications. This objective aligns with the broader aim of the healthcare organization to reduce patient readmission rates by understanding and addressing underlying prescription patterns.

## Research Question
How can the analysis of prescription data reveal patterns of commonly co-prescribed medications that might be pivotal in managing patient readmission risks?

## Method Justification

**Choice of Market Basket Analysis:**
- Rationale: Market basket analysis is adept at examining transactional datasets to identify items frequently purchased together. In this medical context, each prescription is treated as an individual item, providing a unique opportunity to observe correlations between different medications.
- Expected Outcomes: The analysis is expected to yield a comprehensive set of association rules that delineate the relationships between various medications, quantified through metrics like support, confidence, and lift. These insights will not only identify prevalent medication combinations but also provide a statistical basis for understanding their significance in clinical practices.

**Transactional Data Example:**
- Dataset Description: The dataset comprises an array of medication prescriptions, with each patient transaction potentially involving multiple prescriptions.
- Sample Transactions: Transactions vary in complexity, ranging from single-prescription entries to those encompassing multiple medications, providing a rich dataset for analysis.

**Assumption of Market Basket Analysis:**
- Underlying Assumption: The analysis presupposes that medication prescriptions are not random but follow certain discernible patterns, revealing meaningful correlations between different medications.

## Data Preparation and Analysis

**Data Transformation for Analysis:**
Process: The dataset underwent significant transformation to be suitable for market basket analysis. This involved converting prescription data into a format that represents each medication distinctly across transactions, using Boolean values to denote their presence or absence.
- Dataset Refinement: The initial dataset was meticulously refined, with irrelevant and null entries removed to ensure analytical precision.
- Cleaned Dataset: The transformed and cleaned dataset showcases the data's readiness for detailed analysis.

## Data Summary and Implications

**Significance of Findings:**
- Metric Interpretation: The project delved into the implications of the support, lift, and confidence values, providing a nuanced understanding of the medication relationships unearthed through the analysis.
- Insight into Prescribing Patterns: The findings, while indicating certain medication correlations, also pointed to the relative weakness of these relationships based on the quantitative metrics.

**Practical Application of Findings:**
- Clinical Relevance: The identified medication pairs, despite their weak statistical relationships, offer a starting point for clinical investigations into prescription practices and their potential impact on patient readmission rates.

**Recommendations for Healthcare Management:**
-Strategic Insights: The analysis, though revealing limited statistically significant relationships, suggests the need for a more focused dataset. A dataset tailored to specific medical conditions or patient demographics might yield more actionable insights, enabling healthcare providers to refine their prescribing practices and potentially mitigate readmission risks.
