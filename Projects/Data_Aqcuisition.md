# Data Acquisition  

In this project, I successfully merged external CSV data with an existing dataset, a common task in data analysis. 
This project focuses on analyzing and combining data from two distinct sources – an original database and an add-on CSV file – to answer a complex research question. The primary objective is to understand the total revenue generated by each type of internet service across various states.

## Research Question Analysis: 
- The project aims to determine the revenue generated by different types of internet services in each state, requiring data integration and analysis from multiple datasets.

## Data Identification: 
- Identification of crucial data elements from both the original dataset and the add-on CSV file. This includes:
internetservice and customer_id from the 'services' table in the add-on CSV.
customer_id, monthly_charge, and location_id from the 'customer' table in the original dataset.

## Data Modeling and SQL Implementation:
- Creation of a logical data model for the add-on CSV file, emphasizing relational constraints.
Development of SQL scripts for:

![Data Model](/assets/SCR-20231123-rnch.png)

- Table creation accommodating the physical extension of the logical data model.
```sql
CREATE TABLE services
(customer_id text PRIMARY KEY,
InternetService text,
Phone text,
Multiple text,
OnlineSecurity text,
OnlineBackup text,
DeviceProtection text,
TechSupport text);
```

- Data loading from the add-on CSV file into the newly created table.
```sql
COPY services (customer_id,
internetservice, phone,
multiple, onlinesecurity,
onlinebackup,deviceprotection,
techsupport)
FROM 'C:\LabFiles\services.csv'
DELIMITER ','
CSV HEADER;
```

## SQL Querying: 
- Writing SQL queries to extract meaningful insights that answer the research question.
```sql
SELECT l.state AS state
, s. internetservice AS type,
SUM (c. monthly_charge) as revenue
FROM location AS l
INNER JOIN customer AS c
ON l.location_id = c.location_id
INNER JOIN services AS s
ON c.customer_id = s.customer_id
WHERE s.internetservice != 'None'
GROUP BY l.state, s. internetservice
ORDER BY 1.state, type;
```

## Data Refresh Strategy: 
- Determination of a data acquisition and refresh strategy, for this specific projectI recomend quarterly updates to keep the data relevant for business analysis.

## Scripting for Data Loading: 
- Development of an SQL script for automating the data loading process of the add-on data.
```sql
COPY services (customer_id,
internetservice, phone,
multiple, onlinesecurity,
onlinebackup,deviceprotection,
techsupport)
FROM 'C:\LabFiles\services.csv'
DELIMITER ','
CSV HEADER;
```

##Deliverables:
- SQL Scripts for table creation, data loading, and querying.
- A CSV file capturing the results from the queries. ![download](/assets/D205.csv)
