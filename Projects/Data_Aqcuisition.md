# Data Acquisition  

In this completed project, I successfully merged external CSV data with an existing dataset, a common task in data analysis. 
This project focuses on analyzing and combining data from two distinct sources – an original database and an add-on CSV file – to answer a complex research question. The primary objective is to understand the total revenue generated by each type of internet service across various states.

##Research Question Analysis: 
The project aims to determine the revenue generated by different types of internet services in each state, requiring data integration and analysis from multiple datasets.

##Data Identification: 
Identification of crucial data elements from both the original dataset and the add-on CSV file. This includes:
internetservice and customer_id from the 'services' table in the add-on CSV.
customer_id, monthly_charge, and location_id from the 'customer' table in the original dataset.

Data Modeling and SQL Implementation:
Creation of a logical data model for the add-on CSV file, emphasizing relational constraints.
Development of SQL scripts for:
- Table creation accommodating the physical extension of the logical data model.
  
```sql
CREATE TABLE services
(customer_id text PRIMARY KEY,
InternetService text,
Phone text,
Multiple text,
OnlineSecurity text,
OnlineBackup text,
DeviceProtection text,
TechSupport text);
```

- Data loading from the add-on CSV file into the newly created table.

```sql
COPY services (customer_id,
internetservice, phone,
multiple, onlinesecurity,
onlinebackup,deviceprotection,
techsupport)
FROM 'C:\LabFiles\services.csv'
DELIMITER ','
CSV HEADER;
```

Developing Data Models: I crafted conceptual, logical, and physical models to accurately represent the integrated data.
Database Operations: I loaded the new, combined data into a pre-existing database and executed various queries to extract meaningful insights.


Research Inquiry: I formulated and addressed a research question that necessitated data from both the original database and the CSV file, identifying key data elements from each source.

SQL Implementation and Data Loading: I created a logical model for the CSV data and developed SQL code to translate this into a physical model. This included loading the CSV data into the database.

Query Analysis: I utilized SQL to analyze the data in relation to my research question and provided the results in CSV format.

Refresh Strategy: I determined an appropriate schedule for updating the add-on file in the database to maintain data relevancy.

Automation Script: I developed an SQL script for efficiently loading the add-on data.

Project Demonstration: I recorded a video in Panopto, demonstrating the functionality of my code and the programming environment used.

Sourcing and Citation: I meticulously recorded the web sources for data and third-party code and properly cited all used resources.
Professional Presentation: Throughout the project, I maintained a high standard of professional communication.
This project showcased my comprehensive skills in data analysis, from data integration and modeling to analysis, scripting, and effective communication.
