## Data Acquisition  

In this completed project, I successfully merged external CSV data with an existing dataset, a common task in data analysis. 

Integrating Datasets: I explored and combined data from the CSV file and an existing database to create a cohesive dataset.
``` COPY services (customer_id,internetservice, phone,multiple, onlinesecurity, onlinebackup, deviceprotection, techsupport)FROM 'C:\LabFiles\services.csv'DELIMITER ','CSV HEADER; ```

Developing Data Models: I crafted conceptual, logical, and physical models to accurately represent the integrated data.
Database Operations: I loaded the new, combined data into a pre-existing database and executed various queries to extract meaningful insights.
Research Inquiry: I formulated and addressed a research question that necessitated data from both the original database and the CSV file, identifying key data elements from each source.
SQL Implementation and Data Loading: I created a logical model for the CSV data and developed SQL code to translate this into a physical model. This included loading the CSV data into the database.
Query Analysis: I utilized SQL to analyze the data in relation to my research question and provided the results in CSV format.
Refresh Strategy: I determined an appropriate schedule for updating the add-on file in the database to maintain data relevancy.
Automation Script: I developed an SQL script for efficiently loading the add-on data.
Project Demonstration: I recorded a video in Panopto, demonstrating the functionality of my code and the programming environment used.
Sourcing and Citation: I meticulously recorded the web sources for data and third-party code and properly cited all used resources.
Professional Presentation: Throughout the project, I maintained a high standard of professional communication.
This project showcased my comprehensive skills in data analysis, from data integration and modeling to analysis, scripting, and effective communication.
