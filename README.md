## Projects:

This portfolio is a showcase of selected projects I completed during my education, reflecting my ability to tackle complex data challenges.


- [**1.Data Acquisition:**](Projects/Data_Aqcuisition.md)
This project focused on analyzing combined data from an original database and an add-on CSV file to determine the total revenue generated by each type of internet service in various states. Key tasks included identifying essential data from both sources, creating a logical data model and SQL scripts for integrating these data, and performing SQL queries to extract the required information. The goal was to provide insights on revenue generation for a telecommunications company, with data refreshes proposed quarterly for ongoing relevance. The project showcases my skills in data modeling, SQL, and data analysis.

- [**2. Exploring Factors Influencing Readmission Rates (Data Cleaning & PCA):**](Projects/Data_Cleaning.md)
In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of a comprehensive medical dataset to determine the impact of age and being overweight on hospital readmission rates. The dataset, encompassing 50 variables and 10,000 patient records, required extensive data preparation, including cleaning, renaming columns, addressing missing values, and outlier detection. Applying Principal Component Analysis, I identified critical components affecting readmissions. The proyect showcases my proficiency in data processing and analysis within the healthcare sector.

- [**3. Exploratory Data Analysis:**](Projects/Exploratory_DataAnalysis.md)
In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of a medical dataset to examine the relationship between patients' overweight status and readmission rates. Utilizing Python for data analysis, I employed Chi-square testing and univariate and bivariate statistical methods to analyze key variables. The findings indicated no significant dependence of readmission rates on overweight status, despite analyzing 10,000 patient records. The project emphasized my skills in Python, statistical analysis, and data visualization, providing valuable insights for organizations.

- [**4. Predicting Modeling Using Multiple Linear Regression:**](Projects/Predictive_Modeling.md)
In this project, I delved into a medical dataset comprising 10,000 records to identify factors influencing hospital stay durations. Utilizing Python for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis, I applied multiple linear regression, focusing on feature selection through backward elimination to enhance the model's accuracy. The project not only highlighted my technical skills in statistical analysis and Python programming but also emphasized my ability to interpret and communicate complex data insights, showcasing my comprehensive data science expertise.
