## Projects:

This portfolio is a showcase of selected projects I completed during my education, reflecting my ability to tackle complex data challenges.


- [**1.Data Acquisition:**](Projects/Data_Aqcuisition.md)
This project focused on analyzing combined data from an original database and an add-on CSV file to determine the total revenue generated by each type of internet service in various states. Key tasks included identifying essential data from both sources, creating a logical data model and SQL scripts for integrating these data, and performing SQL queries to extract the required information. The goal was to provide insights on revenue generation for a telecommunications company, with data refreshes proposed quarterly for ongoing relevance. The project showcases my skills in data modeling, SQL, and data analysis.

- [**2. Exploring Factors Influencing Readmission Rates (Data Cleaning & PCA):**](Projects/Data_Cleaning.md)
In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of a comprehensive medical dataset to determine the impact of age and being overweight on hospital readmission rates. The dataset, encompassing 50 variables and 10,000 patient records, required extensive data preparation, including cleaning, renaming columns, addressing missing values, and outlier detection. Applying Principal Component Analysis, I identified critical components affecting readmissions. The proyect showcases my proficiency in data processing and analysis within the healthcare sector.

- [**3. Exploratory Data Analysis:**](Projects/Exploratory_DataAnalysis.md)
In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of a medical dataset to examine the relationship between patients' overweight status and readmission rates. Utilizing Python for data analysis, I employed Chi-square testing and univariate and bivariate statistical methods to analyze key variables. The findings indicated no significant dependence of readmission rates on overweight status, despite analyzing 10,000 patient records. The project emphasized my skills in Python, statistical analysis, and data visualization, providing valuable insights for organizations.

- [**4. Predicting Modeling Using Multiple Linear Regression:**](Projects/Predictive_Modeling.md)
In this project, I delved into a medical dataset comprising 10,000 records to identify factors influencing hospital stay durations. Utilizing Python for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis, I applied multiple linear regression, focusing on feature selection through backward elimination to enhance the model's accuracy. The project not only highlighted my technical skills in statistical analysis and Python programming but also emphasized my ability to interpret and communicate complex data insights, showcasing my comprehensive data science expertise.

- [**5. Predicting Modeling Using Logistic Regression**](Projects/Predicting_modeling2.md)
In this project, I utilized logistic regression to analyze a detailed medical dataset, aiming to identify predictors of patient readmission. This involved extensive data cleaning and preparation in Python, ensuring the dataset was primed for accurate analysis. By rigorously applying logistic regression, I navigated through various assumptions and challenges of the model, employing feature selection techniques to refine it further. The project culminated in identifying key health-related factors that influence readmission rates, showcasing my capability in statistical analysis, critical data handling, and deriving meaningful insights from complex datasets, crucial in the healthcare analytics field.

- [**6. Health Care K-nearest Neighbor**](Projects/Data_Mining.md)
In this project, I applied the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classification method to a comprehensive medical dataset to predict patient readmission rates. This project involved extensive data preprocessing, including cleaning and encoding a range of categorical and continuous variables. Utilizing Python and its robust libraries, I effectively managed the dataset, optimized the KNN model through GridSearchCV, and evaluated its performance using accuracy scores and AUC metrics. The analysis revealed the model's high predictive accuracy, although it also highlighted the need for more nuanced data to enhance predictive insights. This project not only demonstrates my technical prowess in handling and analyzing complex healthcare data but also underscores my ability to interpret analytical outcomes and propose actionable recommendations based on the findings.

- [**7.Health Care Lasso Regression**](Projects/data_mining2.md)
In this project I applied Lasso regression to a medical dataset to identify factors influencing the initial length of hospital stays. The project involved a detailed data preparation phase, converting categorical variables to numerical and scaling continuous variables for optimal regression analysis. Using Python and its libraries, I effectively implemented Lasso regression, a method chosen for its ability to perform feature selection in large datasets. The analysis focused on identifying the most influential variables on the 'Initial Days' target variable. The model revealed 'Total Charge' as a significant predictor, highlighting a need for more diverse data to fully understand hospital stay durations. This project not only displayed my technical proficiency in advanced statistical methods and data processing but also my ability to derive actionable insights from complex healthcare data.

[**2.Data Mining II -1 â€“ D212 **](Projects/d212 1 - k means Custering)
Task This project analyzed a medical dataset using k-means clustering to classify patients based on income, initial hospitalization days, total cost, and additional charges. The process involved choosing appropriate clustering techniques, preparing and scaling the data, and determining the optimal number of clusters. The analysis revealed two distinct clusters but also highlighted the limitations of the k-means algorithm, particularly regarding the assumption of feature independence. The project emphasized the importance of careful feature selection in clustering techniques and provided insights into patient classification based on hospitalization data. The project enhanced my skills in data mining, clustering analysis, and the use of Python libraries for data science.
